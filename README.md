# TDD-Vending-Machine-And-More

### This project allowed me to play with and learn Test Driven Development. The main project included is a Vending Machine that allows users to:

- Print Inventory of the machine
- Refill the Inventory if it is low in stock
- Resupply the change in the machine
- Dispense the requested item, assuming enough payment is provided
- Sort and return the change with the fewest amount of coins possible.

### There are also two smaller, separate functions & tests to:

- Compress repeated characters in a string and display the number of characters
- Find the first unique character in a string of letters 

This project was built using Jest.
